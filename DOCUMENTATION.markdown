## Package `LOSH`

This package exports all of the symbols in the other packages.

  If you just want to get everything you can `:use` this one and be done with
  it.  Otherwise you can `:use` only the ones you need.

  

## Package `LOSH.ASTAR`

A★ search in a handy package.

### `ASTAR` (function)

    (ASTAR &KEY START NEIGHBORS GOALP COST HEURISTIC TEST LIMIT GET-SEEN SET-SEEN)

Search for a path from `start` to a goal using A★.

  The following parameters are all required:

  * `start`: the starting state.

  * `neighbors`: a function that takes a state and returns all states reachable
    from it.

  * `goalp`: a predicate that takes a state and returns whether it is a goal.

  * `cost`: a function that takes two states `a` and `b` and returns the cost
    to move from `a` to `b`.

  * `heuristic`: a function that takes a state and estimates the distance
    remaining to the goal.

  * `test`: an equality predicate for comparing nodes.  It must be suitable for
    passing to `make-hash-table`.

  If the heuristic function is admissable (i.e. it never overestimates the
  remaining distance) the algorithm will find the shortest path.  If you don't
  have a decent heuristic, just use `(constantly 0)` to degrade to Dijkstra.

  Note that `test` is required.  The only sensible default would be `eql`, but
  if you were using states that need a different predicate and forgot to pass it
  the algorithm would end up blowing the heap, which is unpleasant.

  The following parameters are optional:

  * `limit`: a maximum cost.  Any paths that exceed this cost will not be
    considered.

  * `set-seen`: a function that takes a state and a cost, and records it.
    If not provided a hash table will be used, but sometimes (depending on what
    your states are) it can be faster to store visited nodes more efficiently.

  * `get-seen`: a function that takes a state and retrieves the stored cost, or
    `nil` if the state has not been seen.

  

## Package `LOSH.ARRAYS`

Utilities related to arrays.

### `BISECT-LEFT` (function)

    (BISECT-LEFT PREDICATE VECTOR TARGET &KEY (KEY #'IDENTITY) (START 0) (END (LENGTH VECTOR)))

Bisect `vector` with `predicate` and return the LEFT element.

  Only the subsequence of `vector` bounded by `start` and `end` is considered.

  `vector` must be sorted (with `predicate`) before this function is called
  (this is not checked).

  You can think of this function as partitioning the elements into two halves:
  those that satisfy `(predicate (funcall key element) target)` and those that
  don't, and then selecting the element on the LEFT side of the split:

      satisfying  not statisfying
    #(..........  ...............)
               ^
               |
          result

  Two values will be returned: the element and its index.  If no element
  satisfies the predicate `nil` will be returned for both values.

  Examples:

    ;                     index
    ;                  0 1 2 3 4 5                                val  index
    (bisect-left '<  #(1 3 5 7 7 9) 5)                     ; =>     3, 1
    (bisect-left '<= #(1 3 5 7 7 9) 5)                     ; =>     5, 2
    (bisect-left '<= #(1 3 5 7 7 9) 7)                     ; =>     7, 4
    (bisect-left '<  #(1 3 5 7 7 9) 1)                     ; =>   nil, nil
    (bisect-left '>  #(9 8 8 8 1 0) 5)                     ; =>     8, 3
    (bisect-left '<  #((1) (2 2) (3 3 3)) 2 :key #'length) ; =>   (1), 0
    (bisect-left '<= #((1) (2 2) (3 3 3)) 2 :key #'length) ; => (2 2), 1

  

### `BISECT-RIGHT` (function)

    (BISECT-RIGHT PREDICATE VECTOR TARGET &KEY (KEY #'IDENTITY) (START 0) (END (LENGTH VECTOR)))

Bisect `vector` with `predicate` and return the RIGHT element.

  Only the subsequence of `vector` bounded by `start` and `end` is considered.

  `vector` must be sorted (with `predicate`) before this function is called
  (this is not checked).

  You can think of this function as partitioning the elements into two halves:
  those that satisfy `(predicate (funcall key element) target)` and those that
  don't, and then selecting the element on the RIGHT side of the split:

      satisfying  not statisfying
    #(..........  ...............)
                  ^
                  |
                  result

  Two values will be returned: the element and its index.  If every element
  satisfies the predicate `nil` will be returned for both values.

  Examples:

    ;                       index
    ;                   0 1 2 3 4 5                                  val  index
    (bisect-right '<  #(1 3 5 7 7 9) 5)                     ; =>       5, 2
    (bisect-right '<= #(1 3 5 7 7 9) 5)                     ; =>       7, 3
    (bisect-right '<= #(1 3 5 7 7 9) 7)                     ; =>       9, 5
    (bisect-right '<  #(1 3 5 7 7 9) 10)                    ; =>     nil, nil
    (bisect-right '>  #(9 8 8 8 1 0) 5)                     ; =>       1, 4
    (bisect-right '<  #((1) (2 2) (3 3 3)) 2 :key #'length) ; =>   (2 2), 1
    (bisect-right '<= #((1) (2 2) (3 3 3)) 2 :key #'length) ; => (3 3 3), 2

  

### `DO-ARRAY` (macro)

    (DO-ARRAY (VALUE ARRAY)
      &BODY
      BODY)

Perform `body` once for each element in `array` using `value` for the place.

  `array` can be multidimensional.

  `value` will be `symbol-macrolet`ed to the appropriate `aref`, so you can use
  it as a place if you want.

  Returns the array.

  Example:

    (let ((arr (vector 1 2 3)))
      (do-array (x arr)
        (setf x (1+ x))))
    => #(2 3 4)

  

### `FILL-MULTIDIMENSIONAL-ARRAY` (function)

    (FILL-MULTIDIMENSIONAL-ARRAY ARRAY ITEM)

Fill `array` with `item`.

  Unlike `fill`, this works on multidimensional arrays.  It won't cons on SBCL,
  but it may in other implementations.

  

### `FILL-MULTIDIMENSIONAL-ARRAY-FIXNUM` (function)

    (FILL-MULTIDIMENSIONAL-ARRAY-FIXNUM ARRAY ITEM)

Fill `array` (which must be of type `(array FIXNUM *)`) with `item`.

  Unlike `fill`, this works on multidimensional arrays.  It won't cons on SBCL,
  but it may in other implementations.

    (FILL-MULTIDIMENSIONAL-ARRAY-SINGLE-FLOAT ARRAY ITEM)

Fill `array` (which must be of type `(array SINGLE-FLOAT *)`) with `item`.

  Unlike `fill`, this works on multidimensional arrays.  It won't cons on SBCL,
  but it may in other implementations.

  

### `FILL-MULTIDIMENSIONAL-ARRAY-T` (function)

    (FILL-MULTIDIMENSIONAL-ARRAY-T ARRAY ITEM)

Fill `array` (which must be of type `(array T *)`) with `item`.

  Unlike `fill`, this works on multidimensional arrays.  It won't cons on SBCL,
  but it may in other implementations.

  

### `VECTOR-LAST` (function)

    (VECTOR-LAST VECTOR)

Return the last element of `vector`, or `nil` if it is empty.

  A second value is returned, which will be `t` if the vector was not empty and
  `nil` if it was.

  The vector's fill-pointer will be respected.

    (TIMING (&KEY (TIME :RUN) (RESULT-TYPE 'INTEGER))
      &BODY
      BODY)

Execute `body`, discard its result, and return the time taken.

  `time` must be one of `:run` or `:real`.

  `result-type` must be `integer` (which will return internal time units) or
  `rational`/`single-float`/`double-float` (which will return seconds).

  

## Package `LOSH.BITS`

Utilities for low-level bit stuff.

## Package `LOSH.CHILI-DOGS`

Gotta go FAST.

### `DEFUN-INLINE` (macro)

    (DEFUN-INLINE NAME
        ARGS
      &BODY
      BODY)

Like `defun`, but declaims `name` to be `inline`.

### `DEFUN-INLINEABLE` (macro)

    (DEFUN-INLINEABLE NAME
      &BODY
      BODY)

Like `defun-inline`, but declaims `name` to be `notinline` afterword.

  This is useful when you don't want to inline a function everywhere, but *do*
  want to have the ability to inline it on demand with (declare (inline ...)).

  

## Package `LOSH.CLOS`

Utilities for working with CLOS.

### `DEFCLASS*` (macro)

    (DEFCLASS* NAME-AND-OPTIONS DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES SLOTS &REST OPTIONS)

`defclass` without the tedium.

  This is like `defclass`, but the `:initarg` and `:accessor` slot options will
  automatically be filled in with sane values if they aren't given.

  `name-and-options` can be a symbol or a list, which will be destructured
  against `(name &key conc-name)`.

  

### `DEFINE-CONDITION*` (macro)

    (DEFINE-CONDITION* NAME-AND-OPTIONS DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES SLOTS &REST OPTIONS)

`define-condition` without the tedium.

  This is like `define-condition`, but the `:initarg` and `:accessor` slot
  options will automatically be filled in with sane values if they aren't given.

  `name-and-options` can be a symbol or a list, which will be destructured
  against `(name &key conc-name)`.

  

### `ENSURE-SLOT-VALUE` (macro)

    (ENSURE-SLOT-VALUE OBJECT SLOT &OPTIONAL DEFAULT)

Return the `slot-value` of `slot` in `object`, setting it to `default` if unbound.

### `SLOT-VALUE-OR` (function)

    (SLOT-VALUE-OR OBJECT SLOT &OPTIONAL DEFAULT)

Return the `slot-value` of `slot` in `object`, or `default` if unbound.

## Package `LOSH.CONTROL-FLOW`

Utilities for managing control flow.

### `_` (macro)

    (_ EXPR &REST FORMS)

Thread the given forms, with `_` as a placeholder.

### `DO-FILE` (macro)

    (DO-FILE (SYMBOL PATH &REST OPEN-OPTIONS &KEY (READER '#'READ-LINE) &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS)
      &BODY
      BODY)

Iterate over the contents of `file` using `reader`.

    During iteration, `symbol` will be set to successive values read from the
    file by `reader`.

    `reader` can be any function that conforms to the usual reading interface,
    i.e. anything that can handle `(read-foo stream eof-error-p eof-value)`.

    Any keyword arguments other than `:reader` will be passed along to `open`.

    If `nil` is used for one of the `:if-…` options to `open` and this results
    in `open` returning `nil`, no iteration will take place.

    An implicit block named `nil` surrounds the iteration, so `return` can be
    used to terminate early.

    Returns `nil`.

    Examples:

      (do-file (line "foo.txt")
        (print line))

      (do-file (form "foo.lisp" :reader #'read :external-format :EBCDIC-US)
        (when (eq form :stop)
          (return :stopped-early))
        (print form))

      (do-file (line "does-not-exist.txt" :if-does-not-exist nil)
        (this-will-not-be-executed))

    

### `DO-IRANGE` (macro)

    (DO-IRANGE RANGES
      &BODY
      BODY)

Perform `body` on the given inclusive `ranges`.

  Each range in `ranges` should be of the form `(variable from to &optional by)`.
  During iteration `body` will be executed with `variable` bound to successive
  values according to `by` in the range [`from`, `to`].

  `from` can be larger than `to`, in which case the values will be stepped down
  instead of up.

  If multiple ranges are given they will be iterated in a nested fashion.

  Example:

    (do-irange ((x  0  4  2)
                (y 11 10))
      (pr x y))
    ; =>
    ; 0 11
    ; 0 10
    ; 2 11
    ; 2 10
    ; 4 11
    ; 4 10

  

### `DO-RANGE` (macro)

    (DO-RANGE RANGES
      &BODY
      BODY)

Perform `body` on the given `ranges`.

  Each range in `ranges` should be of the form `(variable from below)`.  During
  iteration `body` will be executed with `variable` bound to successive values
  in the range [`from`, `below`).

  `from` can be larger than `below`, in which case the values will be stepped
  down instead of up.

  If multiple ranges are given they will be iterated in a nested fashion.

  Example:

    (do-range ((x  0  6  2)
               (y 12 10))
      (pr x y))
    ; =>
    ; 0 12
    ; 0 11
    ; 2 12
    ; 2 11
    ; 4 12
    ; 4 11

  

### `DO-REPEAT` (macro)

    (DO-REPEAT N
      &BODY
      BODY)

Perform `body` `n` times.

### `DO-VECTOR` (macro)

    (DO-VECTOR (VAR-OR-VARS VECTOR &KEY (START NIL START?) (END NIL END?))
      &BODY
      BODY)

Iterate over `vector`, performing `body` with `var-or-vars` bound.

  `var-or-vars` can be one of the following:

  * `value-symbol`
  * `(value-symbol)`
  * `(index-symbol value-symbol)`

  Successive elements of `vector` will be bound to `value-symbol` while `body`
  is executed.  If `index-symbol` is given, the current index will be bound to
  it.

  Returns `nil`.

  

### `GATHERING` (macro)

    (GATHERING
      &BODY
      BODY)

Run `body` to gather some things and return a fresh list of them.

  `body` will be executed with the symbol `gather` bound to a function of one
  argument.  Once `body` has finished, a list of everything `gather` was called
  on will be returned.

  It's handy for pulling results out of code that executes procedurally and
  doesn't return anything, like `maphash` or Alexandria's `map-permutations`.

  The `gather` function can be passed to other functions, but should not be
  retained once the `gathering` form has returned (it would be useless to do so
  anyway).

  Examples:

    (gathering
      (dotimes (i 5)
        (gather i))
    =>
    (0 1 2 3 4)

    (gathering
      (mapc #'gather '(1 2 3))
      (mapc #'gather '(a b)))
    =>
    (1 2 3 a b)

  

### `GATHERING-VECTOR` (macro)

    (GATHERING-VECTOR (&KEY (SIZE 16) (ELEMENT-TYPE T))
      &BODY
      BODY)

Run `body` to gather some things and return a fresh vector of them.

  `body` will be executed with the symbol `gather` bound to a function of one
  argument.  Once `body` has finished, a vector of everything `gather` was
  called on will be returned.  This vector will be adjustable and have a fill
  pointer.

  It's handy for pulling results out of code that executes procedurally and
  doesn't return anything, like `maphash` or Alexandria's `map-permutations`.

  The `gather` function can be passed to other functions, but should not be
  retained once the `gathering` form has returned (it would be useless to do so
  anyway).

  Examples:

    (gathering-vector ()
      (dotimes (i 5)
        (gather i))
    =>
    #(0 1 2 3 4)

    (gathering-vector ()
      (mapc #'gather '(1 2 3))
      (mapc #'gather '(a b)))
    =>
    #(1 2 3 a b)

  

### `IF-FOUND` (macro)

    (IF-FOUND (VAR LOOKUP-EXPR) THEN ELSE)

Perform `then` or `else` depending on the results of `lookup-expr`.

  `lookup-expr` should be an expression that returns two values, the first being
  the result and the second indicating whether the lookup was successful.  The
  standard `gethash` is an example of a function that behaves like this.

  If the lookup was successful, `then` will be executed with `var` bound to the
  result, and its value returned.

  Otherwise `else` will be executed and returned, without any extra bindings.

  Example:

    (multiple-value-bind (val found) (gethash :foo hash)
      (if found
        'yes
        'no))

    ; becomes

    (if-found (val (gethash :foo hash))
      'yes
      'no)

  

### `IF-LET` (macro)

    (IF-LET BINDINGS
      &BODY
      BODY)

Bind `bindings` in parallel and execute `then` if all are true, or `else` otherwise.

  `body` must be of the form `(...optional-declarations... then else)`.

  This macro combines `if` and `let`.  It takes a list of bindings and binds
  them like `let` before executing the `then` branch of `body`, but if any
  binding's value evaluates to `nil` the process stops there and the `else`
  branch is immediately executed (with no bindings in effect).

  If any `optional-declarations` are included they will only be in effect for
  the `then` branch.

  Examples:

    (if-let ((a (progn (print :a) 1))
             (b (progn (print :b) 2))
             (c (progn (print :c) 3)))
      (list a b c)
      'nope)
    ; =>
    :A
    :B
    :C
    (1 2 3)

    (if-let ((a (progn (print :a) 1))
             (b (progn (print :b) nil))
             (c (progn (print :c) 3)))
      (list a b c)
      'nope)
    ; =>
    :A
    :B
    NOPE

  

### `IF-LET*` (macro)

    (IF-LET* BINDINGS
      &BODY
      BODY)

Bind `bindings` sequentially and execute `then` if all are true, or `else` otherwise.

  `body` must be of the form `(...optional-declarations... then else)`.

  This macro combines `if` and `let*`.  It takes a list of bindings and binds
  them like `let*` before executing the `then` branch of `body`, but if any
  binding's value evaluate to `nil` the process stops there and the `else`
  branch is immediately executed (with no bindings in effect).

  If any `optional-declarations` are included they will only be in effect for
  the `then` branch.

  Examples:

    (if-let* ((a (progn (print :a) 1))
              (b (progn (print :b) 2))
              (c (progn (print :c) 3)))
      (list a b c)
      'nope)
    ; =>
    :A
    :B
    :C
    (1 2 3)

    (if-let* ((a (progn (print :a) 1))
              (b (progn (print :b) nil))
              (c (progn (print :c) 3)))
      (list a b c)
      'nope)
    ; =>
    :A
    :B
    NOPE

  

### `MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND*` (macro)

    (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND* BINDINGS
      &BODY
      BODY)

Bind each pair in `bindings` with `multiple-value-bind` sequentially.

  Example:

    (multiple-value-bind*
        (((a b) (values 0 1))
         ((c) (values (1+ b)))
      (list a b c))
    ; =>
    ; (0 1 2)

  From https://github.com/phoe/m-m-v-b

  

### `NEST` (macro)

    (NEST &REST FORMS)

Thread the given forms, putting each as the body of the previous.

  Example:

    (nest (multiple-value-bind (a b c) (foo))
          (when (and a b c))
          (multiple-value-bind (d e f) (bar))
          (when (and d e f))
          (do-something))

  macroexpands to:

    (multiple-value-bind (a b c) (foo)
      (when (and a b c)
        (multiple-value-bind (d e f) (bar)
          (when (and d e f)
            (do-something)))))

  

### `RECURSIVELY` (macro)

    (RECURSIVELY BINDINGS
      &BODY
      BODY)

Execute `body` recursively, like Clojure's `loop`/`recur`.

  `bindings` should contain a list of symbols and (optional) starting values.

  In `body` the symbol `recur` will be bound to the function for recurring.

  This macro doesn't perform an explicit tail-recursion check like Clojure's
  `loop`.  You know what you're doing, right?

  Example:

      (defun length (some-list)
        (recursively ((list some-list)
                      (n 0))
          (if (null list)
            n
            (recur (cdr list) (1+ n)))))

  

### `WHEN-FOUND` (macro)

    (WHEN-FOUND (VAR LOOKUP-EXPR)
      &BODY
      BODY)

Perform `body` with `var` bound to the result of `lookup-expr`, when valid.

  `lookup-expr` should be an expression that returns two values, the first being
  the result (which will be bound to `var`) and the second indicating whether
  the lookup was successful.  The standard `gethash` is an example of a function
  that behaves like this.

  If the lookup was successful, `body` will be executed and its value returned.

  Example:

    (multiple-value-bind (val found) (gethash :foo hash)
      (when found
        body))

    ; becomes

    (when-found (val (gethash :foo hash))
      body)

  

### `WHEN-LET` (macro)

    (WHEN-LET BINDINGS
      &BODY
      BODY)

Bind `bindings` in parallel and execute `body`, short-circuiting on `nil`.

  This macro combines `when` and `let`.  It takes a list of bindings and binds
  them like `let` before executing `body`, but if any binding's value evaluates
  to `nil` the process stops there and `nil` is immediately returned.

  Examples:

    (when-let ((a (progn (print :a) 1))
               (b (progn (print :b) 2))
               (c (progn (print :c) 3)))
      (list a b c))
    ; =>
    :A
    :B
    :C
    (1 2 3)

    (when-let ((a (progn (print :a) 1))
               (b (progn (print :b) nil))
               (c (progn (print :c) 3)))
      (list a b c))
    ; =>
    :A
    :B
    NIL

  

### `WHEN-LET*` (macro)

    (WHEN-LET* BINDINGS
      &BODY
      BODY)

Bind `bindings` sequentially and execute `body`, short-circuiting on `nil`.

  This macro combines `when` and `let*`.  It takes a list of bindings and binds
  them like `let` before executing `body`, but if any binding's value evaluates
  to `nil` the process stops there and `nil` is immediately returned.

  Examples:

    (when-let* ((a (progn (print :a) 1))
                (b (progn (print :b) 2))
                (c (progn (print :c) 3)))
      (list a b c))
    ; =>
    :A
    :B
    :C
    (1 2 3)

    (when-let* ((a (progn (print :a) 1))
                (b (progn (print :b) nil))
                (c (progn (print :c) 3)))
      (list a b c))
    ; =>
    :A
    :B
    NIL

### `DEFINE-WITH-MACRO` (macro)

    (DEFINE-WITH-MACRO TYPE-AND-OPTIONS &REST SLOTS)

Define a with-`type` macro for the given `type` and `slots`.

  This new macro wraps `with-accessors` so you don't have to type `type-`
  a billion times.

  The given `type` must be a symbol naming a struct or class.  It must have the
  appropriate accessors with names exactly of the form `type`-`slot`.

  The defined macro will look something like this:

    (define-with-macro foo a b)
    =>
    (defmacro with-foo ((foo &optional (a-symbol 'a) (b-symbol 'b))
                        &body body)
      `(with-accessors ((,a-symbol foo-a) (,b-symbol foo-b))
           ,foo
         ,@body))

  There's a lot of magic here, but it cuts down on boilerplate for simple things
  quite a lot.

  Example:

    (defstruct foo x y)
    (define-with-macro foo x y)

    (defparameter *f* (make-foo :x 10 :y 20))
    (defparameter *g* (make-foo :x 555 :y 999))

    (with-foo (*f*)

  * A bare symbol will be bound via (nested) `let` to the next expression.
  * `:mv` will bind the next expression (which must be a list of symbols) to the
    expression after it with `multiple-value-bind`.
  * `:db` will bind the next expression (which must be a valid binding) to the
    expression after it with `destructuring-bind`.

  Example:

      (scratch
        a 10
        b 20
        c (+ a b)
        :mv (d e)   (truncate 100 23)
        :db (f (g)) (list 100 (list 22))
        (+ a (- b c) d e (* f g)))

  the iteration limit was reached.

  

### `JUXT` (function)

    (JUXT &REST FUNCTIONS)

    => ((1 2) 3 -1 2)

  

### `NULLARY` (function)

    (NULLARY FUNCTION &OPTIONAL RESULT)

  The new function will return `result` when called with zero arguments, and
  delegate to `function` otherwise.

  Examples:

    (max 1 10 2) ; => 10
    (max)        ; => invalid number of arguments

    (funcall (nullary #'max))          ; => nil
    (funcall (nullary #'max 0))        ; => 0
    (funcall (nullary #'max 0) 1 10 2) ; => 10

    (reduce #'max nil)                  ; => invalid number of arguments
    (reduce (nullary #'max) nil)        ; => nil
    (reduce (nullary #'max :empty) nil) ; => :empty
    (reduce (nullary #'max) '(1 10 2))  ; => 10

Custom `iterate` drivers and clauses.

### `IF-FIRST-ITERATION` (macro)

    (IF-FIRST-ITERATION THEN ELSE)

Evaluate `then` if this clause is executed on the first iteration, otherwise `else`.

  This is similar to from iterate's built-in `if-first-time`, but slightly different:

  * `if-first-time` evaluates `then` the first time the clause is evaluated,
    even if that happens on a subsequent iteration.
  * `if-first-iteration` evaluates `then` only if the clause is evaluated on
    the first iteration.

  Example:

    (iterate
      (for i :from 1 :to 4)
      (collect (cons i (when (evenp i)
                         (list
                           (if-first-time :first-time :later-time)
                           (if-first-iteration :first-iter :later-iter))))))
    ; =>
    ; ((1)
    ;  (2 :FIRST-TIME :LATER-ITER)

  in that it will only evaluate `then` on the first iteration of the loop, 

### `MACROEXPAND-ITERATE` (function)

### `NORM` (function)

    (NORM MIN MAX VAL)

Normalize `val` to a number between `0` and `1` (maybe).

  outside the 0/1 range.

  

### `PRECISE-LERP` (function)

    (PRECISE-LERP FROM TO N)

Lerp together `from` and `to` by factor `n`, precisely.

  Vanilla lerp does not guarantee `(lerp from to 0.0)` will return exactly
  `from` due to floating-point errors.  This version will return exactly `from`
  when given a `n` of `0.0`, at the cost of an extra multiplication.

  

### `RADIANS` (function)

    (RADIANS DEGREES)

Convert `degrees` into radians.

  The result will be the same type as `tau` and `pi`.

    (defparameter *foo* nil)
    *foo* ; => NIL

  `zapf` works like `setf`, but when evaluating the value expressions the symbol
  `%` will be bound to the current value of the place.

  Examples:

    (zapf foo (1+ %)
          (car bar) (if (> % 10) :a :b))

### `DEFINE-SORTING-PREDICATE` (macro)

    (DEFINE-SORTING-PREDICATE NAME PREDICATE-SPEC &REST MORE-PREDICATE-SPECS)

Define `name` as a predicate that composes the given predicates.

  This function takes one or more predicates and composes them into a single
  predicate suitable for passing to `sort`.  Earlier predicates will take
  precedence over later ones — later predicates will only be called to break
  ties for earlier predicates.  This is useful if you want to do something like
  "sort customers by last name, then by first name, then by ID number".

  `predicate-spec` can be one of:

  * A quoted symbol.
  * `(function ...)`
  * `(lambda ...)`
  * A list of `(predicate &key key)`, where `predicate` is any of the above.

  If a `key` is specified, it will be called on arguments before passing them to
  `predicate`.  Note that the `key` only affects the predicate it's consed to,
  not later predicates.

  See `make-sorting-predicate` for a functional version.

  Examples:

    ;; Sort shorter strings first, breaking ties lexicographically:
    (define-sorting-predicate fancy<
      (#'< :key #'length)
      #'string<)

    (sort (list "zz" "abc" "yy") #'fancy<)
    ; => ("yy" "zz" "abc")

    ;; Sort customers by last name, then first name, then ID number:
    (define-sorting-predicate customer<
       (#'string< :key #'last-name)
       (#'string< :key #'first-name)
       (#'< :key #'id))

    (sort (find-customers) #'customer<)

  

### `DOSEQ` (macro)

    (DOSEQ (VAR SEQUENCE)
      &BODY
      BODY)

Perform `body` with `var` bound to each element in `sequence` in turn.

  It's like `cl:dolist`, but for all sequences.

  

### `DROP` (function)

    (DROP N SEQ)

Return a fresh copy of the `seq` without the first `n` elements.

  The result will be of the same type as `seq`.

  If `seq` is shorter than `n` an empty sequence will be returned.

  Example:

    (drop 2 '(a b c))
    => (c)

    (drop 4 #(1))
    => #()

  From Serapeum.

  

### `DROP-WHILE` (function)

    (DROP-WHILE PREDICATE SEQ)

Drop elements from `seq` as long as `predicate` remains true.

  The result will be a fresh sequence of the same type as `seq`.

  Example:

    (drop-while #'evenp '(2 4 5 6 7 8))
    ; => (5 6 7 8)

    (drop-while #'evenp #(2))
    ; => #(2)

  

### `ENUMERATE` (function)

    (ENUMERATE SEQUENCE &KEY (START 0) (STEP 1) KEY)

Return an alist of `(n . element)` for each element of `sequence`.

  `start` and `step` control the values generated for `n`, NOT which elements of
  the sequence are enumerated.

  Examples:

    (enumerate '(a b c))
    ; => ((0 . A) (1 . B) (2 . C))

    (enumerate '(a b c) :start 1)
    ; => ((1 . A) (2 . B) (3 . C))

    (enumerate '(a b c) :key #'alexandria:make-keyword)
    ; => ((0 . :A) (1 . :B) (2 . :C))

  

### `EXTREMA` (function)

    (EXTREMA PREDICATE SEQUENCE &KEY (KEY #'IDENTITY))

Return the smallest and largest elements of `sequence` according to `predicate`.

  `predicate` should be a strict ordering predicate (e.g. `<`).

  Returns the smallest and largest elements in the sequence as two values,
  respectively.

  

### `FREQUENCIES` (function)

    (FREQUENCIES SEQUENCE &KEY (TEST #'EQL) KEY)

Return a hash table containing the frequencies of the elements of `sequence`.

  When `key` is given, it will be called on the elements first before they are
  counted.

  Uses `test` for the `:test` of the hash table.

  Example:

    (frequencies '(foo foo bar))
    => {foo 2
        bar 1}

  

### `GROUP-BY` (function)

    (GROUP-BY FUNCTION SEQUENCE &KEY (TEST #'EQL) (KEY #'IDENTITY))

Return a hash table of the elements of `sequence` grouped by `function`.

  This function groups the elements of `sequence` into buckets.  The bucket for
  an element is determined by calling `function` on it.

  The result is a hash table (with test `test`) whose keys are the bucket
  identifiers and whose values are lists of the elements in each bucket.  The
  order of these lists is unspecified.

  If `key` is given it will be called on each element before passing it to
  `function` to produce the bucket identifier.  This does not effect what is
  stored in the lists.

  Examples:

    (defparameter *items* '((1 foo) (1 bar) (2 cats) (3 cats)))

    (group-by #'first *items*)
    ; => { 1 ((1 foo) (1 bar))
    ;      2 ((2 cats))
    ;      3 ((3 cats)) }

    (group-by #'second *items*)
    ; => { foo  ((1 foo))
    ;      bar  ((1 bar))
    ;      cats ((2 cats) (3 cats)) }

    (group-by #'evenp *items* :key #'first)
    ; => { t   ((2 cats))
    ;      nil ((1 foo) (1 bar) (3 cats)) }

  

### `MAKE-SORTING-PREDICATE` (function)

    (MAKE-SORTING-PREDICATE PREDICATE-SPEC &REST MORE-PREDICATE-SPECS)

Compose the given predicates into a single predicate and return it.

  This function takes one or more predicates and composes them into a single
  predicate suitable for passing to `sort`.  Earlier predicates will take
  precedence over later ones — later predicates will only be called to break
  ties for earlier predicates.  This is useful if you want to do something like
  "sort customers by last name, then by first name, then by ID number".

  `predicate-spec` can be either a function or a cons of `(predicate . key)`,
  in which case the key will be called on arguments before passing them to
  `predicate`.  Note that the `key` only affects the predicate it's consed to,
  not later predicates.

  See `define-sorting-predicate` for a convenient way to define named sorting
  predicates.

  Examples:

    ;; Trivial example:
    (sort (list "zz" "abc")
          (make-sorting-predicate #'string<))
    ; => ("abc" "zz")

    ;; Sort shorter strings first, breaking ties lexicographically:
    (sort (list "zz" "abc" "yy")
          (make-sorting-predicate (cons #'< #'length) #'string<))
    ; => ("yy" "zz" "abc")

    ;; Sort customers by last name, then first name, then ID number:
    (sort (find-customers)
          (make-sorting-predicate
            (cons #'string< #'last-name)
            (cons #'string< #'first-name)
            (cons #'< #'id)))

  

### `NGRAMS` (function)

    (NGRAMS N SEQUENCE)

Return a list of the `n`grams of `sequence`.

  The length of `sequence` must be at least `n`.

  

### `PREFIX-SUMS` (function)

    (PREFIX-SUMS SEQUENCE &KEY KEY (RESULT-TYPE 'LIST))

Return the prefix sums of the elements of `sequence`.

  If `key` is given, it will be called on the elements before summing.
  `result-type` must be a type suitable for passing to `map`.

  Example:

    (prefix-sums '(10 10 10 0 1))
    ; => (10 20 30 30 31)

    (prefix-sums "ABCD" :key #'char-code :result-type '(vector fixnum))
    ; => #(65 131 198 266)

  

### `PRODUCT` (function)

    (PRODUCT SEQUENCE &KEY KEY (INITIAL-VALUE 1) MODULO)

Return the product of all elements of `sequence`.

  If `key` is given, it will be called on each element to compute the
  multiplicand.

  If `initial-value` is given, it will be used instead of 1 to seed the
  multiplication.

  If `modulo` is given the successive products will be modulo'ed by it along the
  way, which can prevent the need for bignums if you don't need the full result.

  Examples:

    (product #(1 2 3))
    ; => 6

    (product #(1 2 3) :modulo 5)
    ; => 1

    (product #(1 2 3) :modulo 5 :initial-value 2)
    ; => 2

    (product '("1" "2" "3") :key #'parse-integer)
    ; => 6

    (product '("1" "2" "3") :key #'length)
    ; => 1

  

### `PROPORTIONS` (function)

    (PROPORTIONS SEQUENCE &KEY (TEST 'EQL) (FLOAT T) KEY)

Return a hash table containing the proportions of the items in `sequence`.

  When `key` is given, it will be called on the elements first before they are
  counted.

  Uses `test` for the `:test` of the hash table.

  If `float` is `t` the hash table values will be coerced to floats, otherwise
  they will be left as rationals.

  Example:

    (proportions '(foo foo bar))
    => {foo 0.66666
        bar 0.33333}

    (proportions '(foo foo bar) :float nil)
    => {foo 2/3
        bar 1/3}

  

### `STRING-JOIN` (function)

    (STRING-JOIN SEPARATOR SEQUENCE)

Join a `sequence` of objects into a string, separated by `separator`.

  All objects in `sequence` (and `separator`) will be `princ`ed before joining.

  

### `SUMMATION` (function)

    (SUMMATION SEQUENCE &KEY KEY (INITIAL-VALUE 0) MODULO)

Return the sum of all elements of `sequence`.

  If `key` is given, it will be called on each element to compute the addend.

  If `initial-value` is given, it will be used instead of 0 to seed the addition.

  If `modulo` is given the successive sums will be modulo'ed by it along the
  way, which can prevent the need for bignums if you don't need the full result.

  This function's ugly name was chosen so it wouldn't clash with iterate's `sum`
  symbol.  Sorry.

  Examples:

    (summation #(1 2 3))
    ; => 6

    (summation '("1" "2" "3") :key #'parse-integer)
    ; => 6

    (summation '("1" "2" "3") :key #'length)
    ; => 3

  

### `TAKE` (function)

    (TAKE N SEQ)

Return a fresh sequence of the first `n` elements of `seq`.

  The result will be of the same type as `seq`.

  If `seq` is shorter than `n` a shorter result will be returned.

  Example:

    (take 2 '(a b c))
    => (a b)

    (take 4 #(1))
    => #(1)

  From Serapeum.

  

### `TAKE-WHILE` (function)

    (TAKE-WHILE PREDICATE SEQ)

Take elements from `seq` as long as `predicate` remains true.

  The result will be a fresh sequence of the same type as `seq`.

  Example:

    (take-while #'evenp '(2 4 5 6 7 8))
    ; => (2 4)

    (take-while #'evenp #(1))
    ; => #()

Run `command`, piping `input` to it, optionally returning its output.

  `command` must be either a string (the program), or a list of the program and
  its arguments.

  `wait` must be a boolean.  If true, this function will block until the command
  completes.  If false, it will return immediately and allow the program to run
  asynchronously.

  `input` must be a character input stream, a string, a list of strings, or
  `nil`.  If non-`nil` its contents will be sent to the program as its standard
  input.  A list of strings will be sent separated by newlines.

  `result-type` must be one of:

  * `null`: output will be sent to `/dev/null` and `nil` returned.
  * `stream`: output will be returned as a character stream.
  * `string`: all output will be gathered up and returned as a single string.
  * `list`: all output will be gathered up and returned as a list of lines.
  * `vector`: all output will be gathered up and returned as a vector of octets.

  If `wait` is `nil`, the only acceptable values for `result-type` are `null`
  and `stream`.
