(defmacro define-with-macro (type-and-options &rest slots)
  "Define a with-`type` macro for the given `type` and `slots`.

  This new macro wraps `with-accessors` so you don't have to type `type-`
  a billion times.

  The given `type` must be a symbol naming a struct or class.  It must have the
  appropriate accessors with names exactly of the form `type`-`slot`.

  The defined macro will look something like this:

    (define-with-macro foo a b)
    =>
    (defmacro with-foo ((foo &optional (a-symbol 'a) (b-symbol 'b))
                        &body body)
      `(with-accessors ((,a-symbol foo-a) (,b-symbol foo-b))
           ,foo
         ,@body))

  There's a lot of magic here, but it cuts down on boilerplate for simple things
  quite a lot.

  Example:

    (defstruct foo x y)
    (define-with-macro foo x y)

    (defparameter *f* (make-foo :x 10 :y 20))
    (defparameter *g* (make-foo :x 555 :y 999))

    (with-foo (*f*)
      (with-foo (*g* gx gy)
        (print (list x y gx gy))))
    =>
    (10 20 555 999)

  "Evaluate `forms` in an imperative fashion.

  Each expression in `forms` will be evaluated, with the following exceptions:

  * A bare symbol will be bound via (nested) `let` to the next expression.
  * `:mv` will bind the next expression (which must be a list of symbols) to the
    expression after it with `multiple-value-bind`.
  * `:db` will bind the next expression (which must be a valid binding) to the
    expression after it with `destructuring-bind`.

  Example:
